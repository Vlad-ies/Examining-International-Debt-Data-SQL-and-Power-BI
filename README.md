# Examining-International-Debt-Data
## Project Description
Human beings don't just borrow money to meet their basic needs. Similarly, nations might also take loans to manage their economies. One instance of this is investing in infrastructure, which is a costly requirement for ensuring a comfortable life for a country's citizens. The entity responsible for providing loans to countries for such purposes is known as the World Bank. <br>
In this undertaking, we examined [global debt](https://github.com/Vlad-ies/Examining-International-Debt-Data/blob/main/debt_image.PNG) information amassed by the World Bank. The dataset includes details about the monetary debt (in US dollars) that developing countries owe. Our task involved uncovering insights to questions like: <br>
1. What is the total amount of debt that is owed by the countries listed in the dataset?
2. Which country owns the maximum amount of debt and what does that amount look like?
3. What is the average amount of debt owed by countries across different debt indicators? <br>
We answered these questions both in [SQL](https://github.com/Vlad-ies/Examining-International-Debt-Data/blob/main/debt_SQL.ipynb) and [Power BI](https://github.com/Vlad-ies/Examining-International-Debt-Data/blob/main/debt_Power%20BI.pbix).
The data employed for this project has been sourced from the World Bank. It encompasses both national and regional debt statistics for numerous countries worldwide, encompassing the time span from 1970 to 2015. <br>
